# Librarian

## How to Run
To run the program, execute the following command in your terminal:

```java Library```

## Implementation
The Librarian program manages collections of Member accounts and Book objects. Each Member account is identified by a unique member number and stores their name, currently rented books, and rental history. Member numbers start at 100000 and increase sequentially.

A Book is identified by its serial number and contains information such as title, author, genre, current borrower, and rental history. Only one member can rent a book at a time. Books with the same title and author are considered copies but have different serial numbers.

Book collections can be read from and saved to CSV files, with each line representing a book in the format:

```
[serial number],[title],[author],[genre]
```

For example:

```
111111,Catch 22,Joseph Heller,Comedy
```
